                   The role of a teacher is to guide, provide intellectual stimuli, coach and nurture thought leaders. The Department of Chemistry draws its strength from highly qualified and dedicated team of four Professors, two Associate Professor, three Senior Grade Assistant Professors, six Assistant Professors and five Teaching fellows. The faculty members are equipped with pedagogical resources, positive experiences, research expertise and a constant desire to grow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are frequently engaged in the conduct / participation of faculty development programs, conferences, seminars and research discussions to imbibe and improve on critical thinking and progress towards excellence. The Departmental functions are ably supported by a motivated team of six technical staff and five administrative personnel. The M. Sc., M.Tech. and M.Phil. students of the Department carry out their projects under the guidance of the Department faculty and also in collaboration with research groups in CLRI, CSIR Laboratories, IGCAR-Kalpakkam, IIT-M and various industrial establishments in Tamil Nadu and the neighboring states. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   Effervescence and Polymera are the annual flagship symposia conducted by the students through the Society for Applied Chemists and Society for Polymer Science and Engineers. About 50 Ph.D. scholars (Full-Time & Part-Time) are currently pursuing research. The Ph.D. scholars and PG students have been actively participating and presenting their research papers in conferences and seminars.

                   Biology section in IISER-Tirupati offers Interdisciplinary education in biology leading to a BS-MS degree where the student learns how biological designs are organised, sustained and evolved in order to exhibit intricate functions at various length and time scales. Class-room teaching goes hand-in-hand with laboratory experiments that reinforce the foundational principles in Biology such that the student develops a deep appreciation towards the mechanistic basis of biological functions.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    We also train students in experimental research leading up to Int.PhD, PhD or post-PhD programmes. Our research programmes span diverse areas such as Cancer Biology, Genome Biology, Infectious & Parasite Biology, Plant & Animal Developmental Biology, Neurobiology, Biochemistry, Ecology & Evolution.
